## FakeNews
Our first awesome PHP-project! (first year web-dev @ [Yrgo](https://yrgo.se/utbildningar/media-och-kommunikation/webbutvecklare/))
 - The assignment was to build a "fake-news" site including authors, articles, publish dates etc.. i chose to get real articles using an API, link below!

## Motivation
At first i wanted to build this using PDO/Sqlite3 but it turned out to be abit over my head. But i still wanted to make it abit more interesting than just arrays of articles i'd write myself.


## Tech/framework used
<b>Built in [Atom](https://atom.io/) with</b>
- [materializecss](https://materializecss.com/)
- All JS, HTML, and PHP is vanilla.

## Installation
If you want to use this you will have to get your own API-key head over to:
[Getting started with newsAPI](https://newsapi.org/docs/get-started)

## API Reference
- [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/)    
	A simple API which gives you JSON-data with a bunch of cool articles based on search criteria.

## How to use?
For intended usage toggle device toolbar to iPhone X or similar.    
**Only use "-" (dashes) in place of spaces in your searches!
Otherwise it crashes**
